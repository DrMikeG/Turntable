## Turntable
The belt drive option is cool as it gives you great sound since it will absorb most of the interference including vibration.

The direct drive is also good, albeit inferior to the belt drive in terms of the quality of the sound produced. It is the drive used by DJs.

## Stylus
The stylus or needle is the part of the turntable that runs in the grooves of the vinyl record. It moves quickly, which causes wear. That is why it is usually made of diamond or some other hard material.

The stylus is available in an elliptical or a spherical shape. Elliptical shapes are good since the grooves touch the stylus more, thus improving the quality of playback. The spherical shape is also nice because of the increased sensitivity. However, the sound is not as good.

## Tonearm & Cartridge

The tonearm is either straight or curved, although that doesn’t affect the sound quality. The tonearm houses the stylus and is connected to the cartridge.

The cartridge is where the signals from the stylus go and it is what transfers the signals to the preamp or amplifier.

## Pre-Amp & Amplifier
These are the components that will create audible music. They transmit sound signals from the record player to the speakers.

> If you want to hook your record player up to external speakers or audio systems, you need a preamp.
> But you may already have one, without even knowing it.

> Some turntables contain internal preamps.
> So do some of the components you might want to connect to your turntable, like a receiver or amplifier.
> If that is the case, you won’t need to buy an additional preamp.

> These internal units are also referred to as a phono stage.
> Often the two terms are used interchangeably, but generally, a phone stage is a built-in preamp, while the word ‘preamp’ can refer to any preamplifier, whether it is internal or standalone.

> How do you know if your record player or other component has an internal preamp? And if it does, is that phono stage any good?

The signal that comes from the cartridge on the record player is approximately 1000 times lower than the signal that comes from a streaming device or a CD player.
In order to hear music from vinyl via your stereo system or your free-standing speakers, it requires a signal boost. That is where a preamp comes in. Whether it is a phono stage or an external preamp, it boosts the signal from the turntable to the correct level, so that it can be received by your stereo system or speakers.

> On the turntable, electric power is applied only to the process of spinning its platter. The stylus in the cartridge does not actually receive any of this power.
> The stylus is the component that generates a signal from the grooves in the vinyl record via movement. This audio signal is then converted into an electrical signal. But this signal is very feeble. With most models, it has an output of 4 mV.
> This is nowhere near the strength of the audio signal from other components like a CD player, so it needs to be boosted. A basic preamp boosts the signal to an output of 300 mV.
> In other words, a signal must be amplified by a factor of 75 in order to be of any use to the amp.
> As you can see, the preamp has a serious job to do and has a major impact on vinyl playback and how your record player performs.



> For example, the operating voltage of raspberry Pi Pico 3.3V and ADC is of 12-bit:
> Resolution = 3.3V/2^12 = 3.3/4095 = 0.8mV
> Therefore, for every 0.8mV on ADC input, the digital value will increment and if we apply 3.3V to the input pin of ADC, the digital output value of ADC will be 4095. 

## What Does A Phono Preamp Do?

A turntable preamp is an audio component that amplifies the signal from a turntable to a higher level, so that it can be received by an audio system, the same way it receives any other type of audio source, like a CD player, etc.

In addition to boosting the signal, a preamp also applies the RIAA equalization curve to the signal. This ensures that the equalization curve has the same shape after amplification as it did before, meaning that the sound does not change at all, apart from being amplified.

We won’t go into any more detail on the RIAA curve. You can read more about it here. Those new to vinyl usually aren’t interested in the complexities of how a preamp work. The most important thing to know is that a preamp is needed in order to enjoy your collection at a volume you can actually hear.

## Does Your Turntable Have A Preamp?
Preamps come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some models are built-in, and many modern turntables do have a phono stage.

Others do not, meaning you’ll need a standalone model. Most audiophiles actually prefer to use a separate preamp, but whether or not it can actually make a difference often depends on the rest of your sound system.

### How do you know if your turntable has one?

There’s actually a pretty simple way to determine this. Try hooking your record player up to your audio system or speakers. If the volume level is high and there are no signs of distortion, then you have a model equipped with a built-in preamp.

Amplifiers And Receivers With Phono Stages
If you have a vintage amp or receiver that was produced before 1980, then it’s likely it has a built-in preamp.

If you’re not sure, look on the back of the device. You should see a label that says phono, with a ground screw right next to it. If you do, it has a preamp.

Most new models of amps and receivers don’t come with a built-in phono preamp, but they may have a label that says phono anyway.

Another way to determine whether or not your model has a phono stage is to plug in your record player and try turning up the volume. If it sounds clear and the volume is booming, then it comes equipped with a built-in phono stage.

## Stereo ##
Vinyl records can either be mono or stereo. Modern records are likely stereo, but there are still mono vinyl records out there. The audio channels are recorded analogously in a spiraling groove in the vinyl material.

Mono vinyl grooves move sideways, like a river, resembling audio frequencies. Stereo grooves have each channel on a separate side of the groove, the inner side is for the left channel and the outer one for the right channel. Both channels are now in a single groove, so the movement has to be angled at 45 degrees per channel.

During the 60s and 70s, both mono and stereo records were being produced. Consumers would have to choose which one they bought based on their audio equipment at home. A lot of mono records are very popular for collectors these days.

There are three main ways to tell if a vinyl record is mono or stereo. The first one is to check the label, which might just tell you. The second way is to listen using headphones and listen for the stereo effect. Finally, you could use an oscilloscope.

### Record Players – Mono Or Stereo ###
Whether a record player can play mono or stereo depends on its cartridge and needle. The cartridge is the device, at the end of the tonearm, that’s used to translate groove shape into an electrical signal representing the recorded audio. The needle, or stylus, is the component of the cartridge that’s tracking the groove shape.
There’s a distinction between real mono cartridges and fake mono cartridges, which are just stereo cartridges wired for a mono signal.

The difference between a stereo cartridge and a real mono cartridge is the following. The mono cartridge uses a spherical stylus, which is expecting the more U-shaped groove that mono records have. A stereo cartridge is more likely to use an elliptical stylus to track a less wide groove with vertical variance.

Stereo cartridges and needles can play both mono and stereo records, but real mono cartridges and needles should only be used to play mono records. **Don’t use mono cartridges for stereo records, because mono cartridges can damage the unexpected shape of the 2-channel stereo groove**.

You can play mono records on a stereo turntable. But a real mono cartridge is worth it for vintage mono records. Mainly because the stylus of a mono cartridge is shaped specifically for the vintage mono groove shape.
